### 138 unscaled features for train/test set 
Generated from `Earthquakes FE. More features and samples` kaggle notebook. Train features are generated from 4194 independent contiguous segments of 150,000 time points. Train/test files are below:
- kaggle_project/kaggle_files/ind_segs/train/standard_138.csv
